<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Actually, I have only been studying web development for two days, so I don't have much experience to show you guys.
  However, I am eager to continue learning becuase I feel very satisfied with my progress so far. 
  Perhaps in my next project, you will see more information about my skills and abilities.</p>

<p>And by the way, I am both a dog and cat person.</p>
